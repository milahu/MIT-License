The '''MIT License''' is a [[Free software|free software license]] that was created at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT). It is a [[permissive software license|permissive]] license, meaning that it allows [[Programmer|programmers]] to put the code in [[proprietary software]] on the condition that the license is given with that software, and [[GNU General Public License#Compatibility and multi-licensing|GPL-compatible]], meaning that the [[GPL]] permits programmers to combine and redistribute it with software that uses the MIT License.

According to the [[Free Software Foundation]], the MIT License is more accurately called the '''X11 license''', since MIT has used many licenses for software and the license was first written for the [[X Window System]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#X11License |title=Various Licenses and Comments about Them |accessdate=2007-07-07 |last=Stallman |first=Richard |publisher=Free Software Foundation }}</ref>

[[Software]] that use the MIT License include [[Expat (XML)|Expat]], [[PuTTY]], [[Mono (software)|Mono development platform]] class libraries, [[Ruby on Rails]], [[Cakephp]], [[Twisted (software)|Twisted]], [[Lua Programming Language|Lua 5.0 onwards]] and the [[X Window System]], which the license was written for.

Some software are [[dual license]]d under the MIT License, such as older versions of the [[cURL]] library, which allowed recipients to choose either the [[Mozilla Public License]] or the MIT License.
