The **MIT License** is a [free software license](Free_software "wikilink") that was created at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "wikilink") (MIT). It is a [permissive](permissive_software_license "wikilink") license, meaning that it allows [programmers](Programmer "wikilink") to put the code in [proprietary software](proprietary_software "wikilink") on the condition that the license is given with that software, and [GPL-compatible](GNU_General_Public_License#Compatibility_and_multi-licensing "wikilink"), meaning that the [GPL](GPL "wikilink") permits programmers to combine and redistribute it with software that uses the MIT License.

According to the [Free Software Foundation](Free_Software_Foundation "wikilink"), the MIT License is more accurately called the **X11 license**, since MIT has used many licenses for software and the license was first written for the [X Window System](X_Window_System "wikilink").[1]

[Software](Software "wikilink") that use the MIT License include [Expat](Expat_(XML) "wikilink"), [PuTTY](PuTTY "wikilink"), [Mono development platform](Mono_(software) "wikilink") class libraries, [Ruby on Rails](Ruby_on_Rails "wikilink"), [Cakephp](Cakephp "wikilink"), [Twisted](Twisted_(software) "wikilink"), [Lua 5.0 onwards](Lua_Programming_Language "wikilink") and the [X Window System](X_Window_System "wikilink"), which the license was written for.

Some software are [dual licensed](dual_license "wikilink") under the MIT License, such as older versions of the [cURL](cURL "wikilink") library, which allowed recipients to choose either the [Mozilla Public License](Mozilla_Public_License "wikilink") or the MIT License.
